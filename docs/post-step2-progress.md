## 🚀 Current Status & Quick Start

### ✅ What's Working Right Now (Step 2 Complete)

**Screenpipe Core System:**
- ✅ **Screen Capture Active**: Recording at 0.5 FPS across 2 monitors
- ✅ **OCR Processing**: Apple Native OCR extracting text from screen captures
- ✅ **Data Storage**: 5,466+ memory objects stored in SQLite database
- ✅ **API Server**: Running at `http://localhost:3030` with full REST API
- ✅ **Real-time Capture**: Terminal sessions, app windows, browser content being captured

**Evidence of Working System:**
```bash
# Health check shows active capture
curl -s http://localhost:3030/health | jq '.'
# Returns: {"status": "degraded", "frame_status": "ok", "last_frame_timestamp": "2025-09-18T09:10:56.180108Z"}
# Search shows captured data
curl -s "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=1" | jq '.data[0]'
# Returns: Real OCR text from your screen with app names, timestamps, window titles
```

### 🔧 Manual Setup & Operation

**Prerequisites:**
- macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon recommended)
- Node.js 20+ with pnpm
- Screenpipe installed (✅ Already done via `./screenpipe/install.sh`)

**Start the System:**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/kumar/Documents/Projects/memories

# 2. Kill any existing Screenpipe processes
pkill -f screenpipe

# 3. Start Screenpipe with optimal settings
~/.local/bin/screenpipe \
    --fps 0.5 \
    --port 3030 \
    --data-dir ./data \
    --ocr-engine apple-native \
    --disable-audio \
    --debug \
    --enable-frame-cache \
    --capture-unfocused-windows \
    > logs/screenpipe-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &

echo "Screenpipe PID: $!"
```

**Verify It's Working:**
```bash
# Wait 10 seconds for startup
sleep 10

# Check health (should show "degraded" but frame_status "ok")
curl -s http://localhost:3030/health | jq '.'

# Check data count (should show thousands of records)
curl -s "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=1" | jq '.pagination.total'

# See sample captured data
curl -s "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=1" | jq '.data[0].content'
```

**Debug & Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Use our debug script for comprehensive testing
./scripts/debug-screenpipe.sh all

# Manual API tests
curl -s "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&q=terminal&limit=3" | jq '.'
curl -s "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=5" | jq '.data[0]'

# Check logs
tail -f logs/screenpipe-*.log
```

### 📊 Current Data Capture

**What's Being Captured:**
- ✅ **Screen Text**: OCR from all visible text on screen
- ✅ **App Context**: Application names, window titles
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Precise capture timing
- ✅ **Media Files**: Video recordings stored in `./data/data/`
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite with FTS5 indexing at `./data/db.sqlite`

**Sample Captured Data:**
```json
{
  "type": "OCR",
  "content": {
    "frame_id": 5416,
    "text": "Terminal commands, git operations, file contents...",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-18T09:10:56.180108Z",
    "app_name": "Terminal",
    "window_name": "justcall — -bash — 80×24",
    "file_path": "./data/data/monitor_2_2025-09-18_09-05-31.mp4"
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes

**Why localhost:3030 Shows 404:**
- Screenpipe is an **API server**, not a web application
- ✅ API endpoints work: `/health`, `/search`
- ❌ No web UI at root path (this is expected)

**Content Types:**
- `ocr` = Screen text extracted from visual captures (this IS vision data)
- `audio` = Audio transcription (disabled in our setup)
- `ui` = UI element detection (requires accessibility permissions)
- `all` = All content types combined

## 🏗️ Implementation Status

**✅ COMPLETED (Step 2: Screenpipe Integration)**
- [x] Screenpipe installed and configured
- [x] Screen capture working (0.5 FPS, 2 monitors)
- [x] OCR processing active (Apple Native)
- [x] API server running (port 3030)
- [x] Data storage working (5,466+ records)
- [x] TypeScript client interfaces created
- [x] Debug tools and scripts created

**🔄 IN PROGRESS (Step 3: Ingest Bridge Service)**
- [ ] Node/TS service to consume Screenpipe API
- [ ] MemoryObject canonical schema implementation
- [ ] SQLite FTS5 + Chroma vector database setup
- [ ] OpenAI embeddings integration
- [ ] Thumbnail generation pipeline

**⏳ PENDING (Steps 4-7)**
- [ ] Search API Service (hybrid search + confidence scoring)
- [ ] Nugget Extractors (prices, scores, titles)
- [ ] SwiftUI Overlay Application (⌥⌘M hotkey + glass UI)
- [ ] Demo data seeding and verification

**📈 Progress Metrics:**
- **Data Capture**: ✅ 5,466+ memory objects stored
- **API Functionality**: ✅ All endpoints responding correctly
- **OCR Quality**: ✅ Capturing readable text from terminal, apps
- **Performance**: ✅ Stable operation, reasonable resource usage
- **Next Milestone**: Build Ingest Bridge to normalize Screenpipe data

### 🎯 What This Means

**Your Core Vision is Working:**
- ✅ Screen capture and OCR are actively recording your desktop
- ✅ Text from terminals, browsers, apps is being extracted and stored
- ✅ The foundation for "photographic memory" is operational
- ✅ API provides access to thousands of captured screen moments

**Next Steps:**
1. **Step 3**: Build Ingest Bridge to normalize and enhance the raw Screenpipe data
2. **Step 5**: Create Search API with hybrid search and confidence scoring
3. **Step 7**: Build SwiftUI overlay for the ⌥⌘M user interface

The system is capturing your screen activity right now - we just need to build the intelligence and interface layers on top of this working foundation.
